    "## Introduction\n",
    "The idea for this short course was born from a request from some of my collegues. Some of them come from a backgrouds where none or little computer science (or even basic programming) is done. One of the most used tools in the academic sector is Matlab: it is fairly easy to learn, very powerful and with a lot of toolbox for various applications. However, with time I have come to dislike it as its flaws became more and more evident (starting with its terrible backwards-compatibility). In particular, the high level of complexity I have encountered in doing normal scripting tasks and the lack of Object-Oriented functionality is what persuaded me to find an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **why Pyhton**? I have first come in contact with this language many years ago in the field of videogames (it was actually a simple scripting language based on python and the `pygame` module). To get more complex behaviour, knowledge of the python language was required, so I started to study it (on the book _Think Python-1st edition_, which at the time was based on Python2). I immediately loved it for the concept of _Objects_, which was new to me, and for its simplicity compared to C, so much than the author of the book recomended it as an alternative to teach programming in schools.  \n",
    "It was not until much later that I have started using it for scientific computations, when I was in university. We were supposed to use Matlab in some classes and the compatibility with Linux was not great at that time. When I had no lab computers available and I had to use my own laptop, I started to use [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), but the results were not satisfying. At this time I finally discovered _numpy_ and _matplotlib_ and a new world opened before me."

If you feel that you are lacking in these aspects, or just need a quick review I will provide a _**Lesson 0**_ ([link] coming) for self-study.  \n",
